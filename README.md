## PART I: INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY

### 1. Bayesian Thinking and Everyday Reasoning

#### Exercises

**Q1.** *Rewrite the following statements as equations:*

* *The probability of rain is low* : **P(rain) = low**
* *The probability of rain given that it is cloudy is high* : **P(rain | cloudy) = high** 
* *The probability of you having an umbrella given it is raining is much greater than the probability of you having an umbrella in general* : **P(umbrella | raining) >> P(umbrella)** 

**Q2.** *Organize the data you observe in the following scenario into a mathematical notation. Then come up with a hypothesis to explain this data: [You come home from work and notice that your front door is open and side window is broken. Inside, you immediately notice that your laptop is missing]*

**P(door, window, no-laptop | H1) = high** ...where H1 = burglary

**Q3.** *The following scenario adds data to the previous one. Demonstrate how this new information changes your beliefs and come up with a second hypothesis to explain the data: [A neighborhood child runs up and apologizes profusely for accidentally throwing a rock through your window. They claim that they saw the laptop and didn’t want it stolen, so it is safe at their house]*

**P(door, window, no-laptop | H2, child)** ...where H2 = accident

**P(D | H2) >> P(D | H1)** ...where D = door open, window broken, laptop missing

### 2. Measuring Uncertainty

#### Exercises

**Q1.** *What is the probability of rolling two six-sided dice and getting a value greater than 7?* **{2+6, 3+5, 3+6, 4+4, 4+5, 4+6, 5+3, 5+4, 5+5, 5+6, 6+2, 6+3, 6+4, 6+5, 6+6} --> 15/36 --> 0.417**

**Q2.** *What is the probability of rolling three six-sided dice and getting a value greater than 7?* **{1+1+6, 1+2+5, 1+2+6, 1+3+4, 1+3+5, 1+3+6, 1+4+3, 1+4+4, 1+4+5, 1+4+6, 1+5+2, 1+5+3, 1+5+4, 1+5+5, 1+5+6, 1+6+1, 1+6+2, 1+6+3, 1+6+4, 1+6+5, 1+6+6, 2+1+5, 2+1+6, etc etc} --> 181/216 --> 0.838**

**Q3.** *The Yankees are playing the Red Sox. You’re a diehard Sox fan and bet your friend they’ll win. You’ll pay your friend $30 if the Sox lose and receive only $5 if the Sox win. What is the probability you have intuitively assigned to the belief that the Red Sox will win?*

**Odds of 30:5 or 6:1 --> P(win) = 6/7 or 0.857**
