## PART I: INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY

### 1. Bayesian Thinking and Everyday Reasoning

#### Exercises

**Q1.** *Rewrite the following statements as equations:*

* *The probability of rain is low* : **P(rain) = low**
* *The probability of rain given that it is cloudy is high* : **P(rain | cloudy) = high** 
* *The probability of you having an umbrella given it is raining is much greater than the probability of you having an umbrella in general* : **P(umbrella | raining) >> P(umbrella)** 

**Q2.** *Organize the data you observe in the following scenario into a mathematical notation. Then come up with a hypothesis to explain this data: [You come home from work and notice that your front door is open and side window is broken. Inside, you immediately notice that your laptop is missing]*

**P(door, window, no-laptop | H1) = high** ...where H1 = burglary

**Q3.** *The following scenario adds data to the previous one. Demonstrate how this new information changes your beliefs and come up with a second hypothesis to explain the data: [A neighborhood child runs up and apologizes profusely for accidentally throwing a rock through your window. They claim that they saw the laptop and didnâ€™t want it stolen, so it is safe at their house]*

**P(door, window, no-laptop | H2, child)** ...where H2 = accident

**P(D | H2) >> P(D | H1)** ...where D = door open, window broken, laptop missing
